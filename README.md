Qobuz-30.1.0.zip  version 30.1.0
-

This is my enhanced personal version of the Qobuz Plugin from Pierre Beck and Michael Herger.

A large number of extensions, improvements and bug fixes are included. To list everything that I have compiled over many years would simply be too time-consuming at the moment. It's best if you just try it out.
If you use 'Material' by Craig Drummond you can individually set the view type (grid view or list view) in each submenu in which images are displayed and the plugin now remembers this setting. Thanks again to Craig for implementing the prerequisite for this feature.
Basically, I always follow Michael Herger's improvements and incorporate them into my version with a little delay.
So that the versions don't get in each other's way, my version always has a 0 after the first version number.
If the version of the original plugin is 2.16.10, my version would then be 20.16.10. This means that all improvements from Michael are included until version 2.16.10.

History-1.4.5.zip  version 1.4.5
-

The second plugin creates a playback history that shows a kind of playlist with all the songs you have listened to recently.
I've always missed something like this and find it quite practical.
At the same time, the plugin corrects a few problems with the LMS favorites. Here too, just try it out and you will see what has changed. The plugin is independent of other plugins.

The address of the repository as it must be entered at LMS Settings - Manage Plugins is as follows:
